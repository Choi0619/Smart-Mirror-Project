# Smart Mirror

## Description
This repository contains all the resources the team needs for installing and modifying the Raspberry Pi into a **smart mirror**. The smart mirror is designed to enhance convenience by displaying **schedules**, **dates**, **weather**, and integrating **Google Assistant** for voice commands. The mirror is embedded in a **one-way mirror**, allowing for a sleek, transparent display that fits seamlessly into the user's daily life.

## Key Features:
- **Schedule display**: Keep track of your calendar events.
- **Date and time display**: Always stay updated.
- **Weather information**: Get real-time weather forecasts.
- **Google Assistant integration**: Control the mirror with your voice.

By using a one-way mirror, the display is visible when powered on and blends in as a regular mirror when not in use. This project brings added convenience and smart functionality to everyday life.

### Installation Guide:
You can find the installation instructions [here](how-to.md).
